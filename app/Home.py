# Birdwatcher

## Welcome!

Welcome my fellow bird enthusiasts üê¶üòÇ! All joking aside, this is a
web app designed to display sentiment distributions associated with
particular topics on twitter. (i.e. birdwatching; get it üòâ?) 

## Navigating The App

Over on the left-hand side, you'll find a list of topics I chose to
monitor. Clicking on one will take you to page displaying sentiment
distribution visualizations. You'll find two plots:

1. A pie chart, indicating the sentiment distribution using recent
(within the last week) tweets only.
2. A line graph, visualizing changes in this distribution over time.

## Links

The source code for both the sentiment analysis pipeline and app
front-end can be found in my GitHub: [twitter-sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/BobbyLumpkin/twitter-sentiment-analysis/tree/main)
